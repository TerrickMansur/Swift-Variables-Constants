# Swift-Variables-Constants
A simple playground file that shows how to declare variables and constants in swift I wrote when I was creating the "Swift Variables and Constant" tutorial on YouTube.

The tutorial covers how to:

- Create a variable 
- Create a constant 
- How to use type annotations
- Show how you can name variables using emojis
